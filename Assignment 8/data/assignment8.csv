Joshua Dublin ,Jadyn's project looks into the pros and cons of the rapid evolution of AI. She looks into the implications of XR technologies. XR technologies are becoming prevelant in society. By examining XR technologies she hopes to gain understanding of how AI will shape the human experience.,<a href="https://167.99.253.247/csc543/reillyj18/project1">Link To My Project</a>,3,5,Jadyn's project achieves a similar appearance across three implementations. She successfully uses HTML/CSS/JavaScript PHP and React to create the implementations. Overall Jadyn's project is very successful. The project is very well organized and the analysis is excellent.,Look into several other AI techonologies besides XR technologies,What made you decide on HTML/CSS/Javascript PHP and React?,Thank you for your feedback Joshua! Exploring various AI technologies beyond XR is a great idea and I will definitely consider incorporating that into my project in the future. I chose those three implementations because of their versatility in allowing me to create interactive webpages. I had never used PHP or React before so was interested in exploring their capabilities.
Kyle Mercado ,Exploring the implications of XR technology,<a href="https://167.99.253.247/csc543/reillyj18/project1">Link To My Project</a>,4,7,The implementations look great I think we get a lot of information to read but I would love a way to showcase these benefits in limitations through visual demonstration such as videos or pictures,N/A,N/A,Thank you for your feedback Kyle! I am glad you liked my implementations and found them to be informative.  Incorporating visual demonstrations such as videos or pictures to show the benefits and limitations is a great suggestion that I'll consider for enhancing my project in the future.
Q Thompson,Jadyn's project focuses on analyzing the pros and cons of Extended Reality (XR) technologies given their rapid advancement and increasing prevalence across various industries. I can see that Jadyn is motivated by the continuous evolution of technology and aims to explore the implications of XR on society human interactions and experiences. ,<a href=""https://167.99.253.247/csc543/reillyj18/project1">Link To My Project</a>,4,5,This is a very interesting topic and with great detail. thank you for educating me on this topic. My knowledge was vague at best,Maybe a video demonstration on how the three different technologies work? the functionalities of them?,Do you currently use any of these technologies?,Thank you for your feedback Q! I am happy that I was able to enhance your knowledge on XR through my project! Incorporating videos to show the functionalities of these technologies is a great suggestion for a more interactive learning experience. To answer your question I currently have a VR headset for PlayStation. I havent used it in a while but it was truly an unreal experience the first time I used it and one of the reasons I chose the topic for my project. 
Paulo Muniz ,Great job on your project about how fast AI is changing especially with XR technology. You did a good job showing both the good and bad sides of it.,<a href="https://167.99.253.247/csc543/reillyj18/project1">Link To My Project</a>,4,3, Ethical Issues: How will you deal with the ethical problems XR brings up? It's an important part of your project. Widen Your Study: Maybe look at more ways XR is changing different parts of our lives not just web tech. Dig Deeper: It would be cool to see more examples or ideas about how XR is changing society.,N/A,N/A,Thank you for your feedback Paulo! I'm glad you found my exploration of AI's rapid evolution with XR informative and balanced in addressing both its benefits and limitations. Your points on addressing ethical issues widening the study to show various aspects of XR's impact and delving deeper into examples of XR's societal changes are valuable suggestions that highlight important areas for future exploration!
Aerron Ward ,An analysis of the pros and cons related to the rapid technological advances of Artificial Intelligence focusing on extended reality (XR) technologies in education.,<a href="https://167.99.253.247/csc543/reillyj18/project1">Link To My Project</a>,3,7,Good analysis of the information very informative. The layout of both pros and cons were very straightforward to look at.,N/A,Which XR technology do you think performs the best in terms of educational learning?,Thank you for your feedback Aerron!I am glad you found my analysis informative and the layout of pros and cons straightforward. Ensuring clarity for the information I presented was a priority in my project's design. To answer your question I think that virtual reality (VR) performs the best for immersive and experiential learning experiences in education because of its immersive nature and realistic simulations.
Peter Chukwu ,The study aims to analyze the pros and cons of rapid technological advances in Artificial Intelligence with a focus on Extended Reality (XR) technologies. The research highlights the benefits consequences and ethical concerns of XR technologies in shaping human interactions and experiences.,<a href="https://167.99.253.247/csc543/reillyj18/project1">Link To My Project</a>,4,3,The research provides a comprehensive analysis of XR technologies' impact on society. The use of multiple implementations showcases the effects on various web technologies.,Consider expanding the study to include more diverse aspects of XR technologies and their specific impacts on different sectors. Explore advanced methodologies and frameworks for a deeper understanding of the societal implications of XR technologies.,How do you plan to address the ethical concerns surrounding XR technologies in your analysis?,Thank you for your feedback Peter! I am glad you found my analysis comprehensive and informative. Your suggestions to expand my study to include more diverse aspects of XR technologies and explore advanced methodologies for understanding their societal implications is a great idea that I will consider incorporating for the future! To answer your question I'd plan to address this by examining ethical frameworks and guidelines by considering potential risks and consequences and proposing strategies for responsible deployment which prioritizes user safety privacy and well being.
Deborah Olivares ,Jadyn examined the pros and cons of XR technologies and it's role in the shaping of current and future human interactions/experiences.,<a href="https://167.99.253.247/csc543/reillyj18/project1">Link To My Project</a>,5,6,N/A,I really love the style of the webpages! I think the information provided is great too but could benefit from adding some data like for example giving actual costs of these devices and data about their popularity.,N/A,Thank you for your feedback Deborah!
